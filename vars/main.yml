# NOTE(curtis): libostree-dev comes from flatpak ppa
# NOTE(curtis): golang-go that comes with OS is way too old, 1.8.5 doesn't work either
# NOTE(curtis): runc can come from the atomicproject ppa, but it puts runc in /usr/sbin
# as opposed to /usr/bin/ where it seems the crio.conf file that is generated from make
# config goes.
